# Plugin `sap.commerce.build.ccv2`

This plugins parses Commerce Cloud v2 [`manifest.json`][manifest] file and provides it to the Gradle build script.

If you also use the `sap.commerce.build` plugin, it preconfigures various tasks based on `manifest.json`

[manifest]: https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/latest/en-US/2be55790d99e4a1dad4caa7a1fc1738f.html

## Configuration

The following example shows the full DSL (Domain Specific Language) with all default options and the dependencies the
plugin pre-configures.

```groovy
CCV2 {
    //target folder for the `generate*` tasks (details see below)
    generatedConfiguration = file('generated-configuration')

    //Use this property to access the manifest.json in your Gradle build script
    manifest = < parsed manifest.json >
}

```

If you also use `sap.commerce.build` in your build, the `hybris.version` is preconfigured with `commerceSuiteVersion` of
the manifest.

### `extenionPacks` Support

All artifacts configured as additional `extensionPacks` in your `manifest.json` will also be unpacked into the root of
your repository during [`bootstrapPlatform`][bootstrap]. This allows you to easily bootstrap e.g. the "Integration
Extension Pack" locally.

- [Deploying the Integrations Pack on SAP Commerce Cloud][pack]
- [Extension Packs][packs]

**How are `extensionPacks` resolved as Maven artifacts?**

- If `name` / `version` is supplied:\
  `de.hybris.platform:${name}:${version}@zip`
- If `artifact` is supplied:\
  `${artifact}` (as is, without any changes)\
  (If `artifact` is configured, `name` and `version` are ignored, as specified in the docs)

### `useCloudExtensionPack` Support

> The Cloud Extension Pack is only available for SAP Commerce 1811 and 1905.\
> Starting with 2005, it is replaced by the "Integration Extension Pack" (see above)

If the cloud extension pack is enabled in your `manifest.json` (`useCloudExtensionPack: true`), the `bootstrapPlatform`
task will automatically:

- Download and unpack the extension pack (artifact
  coordinates: `de.hybris.platform:hybris-cloud-extension-pack:<commerce-version-without-patch>.+`)
  into `cloud-extension-pack`
- Patch `localextensions.xml` to load the extensions from the cloud extension pack, if necessary

## Tasks

The plugin defines the following tasks

### `validateManifest`

Validate `manifest.json` for common issues. If errors are detected, the task fails. Warnings are logged, but do not
cause the task to fail.

You can find all possible errors and warnings in [ccv2-validation.md](ccv2-validation.md)

### `installManifestAddons`

**Only available if the build also uses `sap.commerce.build`**

Runs `ant addonistall` for all addons defined in `storefrontAddons` of the manifest.

### `cloudTests`

**Only available if the build also uses `sap.commerce.build`**

Runs `ant alltests` preconfigured with the values of the [`tests`][tests] object of the manifest

[tests]: https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/latest/en-US/5ae6471137c44947a4f3051c753229d7.html

### `cloudWebTests`

**Only available if the build also uses `sap.commerce.build`**

Runs `ant webtests` preconfigured with the values of the [`webTests`][webtests] object of the manifest

[webtests]: https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/latest/en-US/e978c15cad464c9eabb67bd868154377.html

### `generateCloudProperties`

Generates `*.properties` files (into the folder configured by `CCV2.generatedConfiguration`) per aspect and persona as
defined in `manifest.json`.

The aspect `common` is used for the properties that are shared between all aspects.

### `generateCloudLocalextensions`

Generates a `localextensions.xml` file (into the folder configured by `CCV2.generatedConfiguration`) based on
the `extensions` list in the manifest.
