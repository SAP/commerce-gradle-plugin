Thank you [@tklostermannNSD] for adding the 2105 / 2108 compatibility check!

Special shout out to [@aepfli] for not only adding lazy configuration to `HybrisAntTas` and improving
the Windows compatibility, but for also adding the much-needed OS compatibility check to our
GH Actions flow.

## [3.5.0] 2021-04-21

### Added

- Task `validateManifest` - Validate Integration Extension Pack\
  Ensure that the correct Integration Extension Pack is used.

### Changed

- `manifest.json` - Stricter validation for `extensionPacks`. Invalid entries now cause the parser to fail.

### Fixed

- Task `unpackPlatform` could fail in case of duplicate files. Now Gradle will emit a warning and overwrite the file.

## [3.4.0] 2021-03-15

### Added

- Task `validateManifest` \
  Validate `solrVersion` and warn if you customize solr without pinning the version.

## [3.3.0] 2021-01-20

### Added

- Task `validateManifest` - New Validations

  - Check if of cloud media conversion is correctly configured
  - Fail if `<extension>.webroot` properties are used

## [3.2.0] 2021-01-15

### Added

- CCv2: New Task `validateManifest`\
  Validate your `manifest.json` for common errors locally, instead of detecting error only after you have triggered
  the build in the cloud portal or, even worse, during deployment.\
  For details please check the [user documentation](docs/Plugin-sap.commerce.build.ccv2.md#validatemanifest)

- CCv2: Task `installManifestAddons`\
  Support for `storefrontAddons.addons`/ `storefrontAddons.storefronts` arrays ([Documentation][addons])

- Build: Configure default task dependencies for generated ant tasks ([#24])\
  You can now configure the default dependencies for ant tasks generated by the [ant task rule](docs/Plugin-sap.commerce.build.md#hybris-ant-rule)

  ```gradle
  hybris {
    antTaskDependencies.set(listOf("bootstrapPlatform"))
  }
   ```

[#24]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/issues/24

### Changed

- CCv2: Task `installManifestAddons`\
  Addons are now installed exactly in the same way as they are in the cloud build.

## [3.1.0] - 2020-12-23

### Added

- `removeUnusedExtensions` - remove all extensions that the project doesn't use (to save disk space)

## [3.0.0] - 2020-09-25

### Changed

- **Plugin IDs**\
  The new plugin IDs are:
  - `sap.commerce.build`
  - `sap.commerce.build.ccv2`
  - `sap.commerce.ccv1.package`

### Removed

- Removed `SupportPortalDownload`

## [2.1.1] - 2020-09-25

### Deprecated

- **Plugin IDs**\
  Since the plugin recently moved to the SAP open source organization, the plugin will soon be updated to reflect this change

  |Old|New|
  |---|---|
  |`mpern.sap.commerce.build`|`sap.commerce.build`|
  |`mpern.sap.commerce.build.ccv2`|`sap.commerce.build.ccv2`|
  |`mpern.sap.commerce.ccv1.package`|`sap.commerce.ccv1.package`|

- Task Type `SupportPortalDownload`\
  The logic to determine the download link for an artifact is quite complex and brittle,
  and there are easier ways to do achieve the same outcome.\
  Check the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) for more information


## [2.1.0] - 2020-06-16

### Added

- CCv2 Plugin: Support `extensionPacks` array ([docs][ref]). This is especially relevant for the new ["Integration Extension Pack"][pack]

[ref]: https://help.sap.com/viewer/1be46286b36a4aa48205be5a96240672/latest/en-US/ad98c976ab3d433e935b4b5c89303dd5.html
[pack]: https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_COMMERCE_INTEGRATIONS/latest/en-US

During the execution of the `bootstrapPlatform` task, the plugin resolves extension packs as dependencies as follows:

- `name` / `version` :\
    `de.hybris.platform:${name}:${version}@zip`
- `artifact`:\
    `${artifact}` (as is, without any changes)\
    if `artifact` is configured, `name` and `version` are ignored (as specified in the docs)

The plugin unpacks all resolved dependencies into the project root folder. (the same way as the platform.zip is unpacked).

### Changed

- Changed the default value for `hybris.cleanGlob` to `glob:**hybris/bin/{ext-**,platform**,modules**}` to match the new folder structure.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-02-16

### Added

- Support Gradle 6.x

### Removed

- Dropped support for Gradle 4.x due to changes in the Gradle Plugin API in 6.x

## [1.5.1] - 2019-10-22

### Fixed

- Change the file format of the deployment package checksum file to follow the latest packaging guidelines. ([#15])

[#15]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/pull/15

A big "thank you" to [@I048752] for providing the fix!

## [1.5.0] - 2019-08-09

### Added

- CCv2 Plugin: Cloud Extension Pack support

If the cloud extension pack is enabled in your `manifest.json` (`"useCloudExtensionPack": true`), the `bootstrapPlatform` task will automatically:

- download and unpack the extension pack (artifact coordinates: `de.hybris.platform:hybris-cloud-extension-pack:<commerce-version-without-patch>.+`) into the folder `cloud-extension-pack`
- patch `localextensions.xml` to load the extensions from the cloud extension pack, if necessary


### Changed

- Install addons defined in `manifest.json` faster


## [1.4.0] - 2019-04-09

### Added

- Task `buildCCV1Package` now declares task outputs - you can now easily (post)process the generated package ([#12])

[#12]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/issues/12

## [1.3.3] - 2019-03-29

### Fixed

- Ensure correct ccv1 deployment package name ([#11])

[#11]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/issues/11

## [1.3.2] - 2019-03-18

### Fixed

- Fix calling ant targets on the SAP JVM ([#10])

### Fixed

-  CCv2 plugin correctly parses a minimal `manifest.json` ([#9])

[#9]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/issues/9

## [1.3.0] - 2019-01-18

### Added

- Gradle 5+ support\
  Check the [kotlin-dsl-example][example] repository on how to write your build with the Kotlin DSL

- New property `sha256Sum` for `SupportPortalDownloadTask` to support checksums available on launchpad.support.sap.com (More details in the [documentation][doc] and the [FAQ][faq])

## [1.2.2] - 2019-01-17

### Changed

- CCv2 Plugin: you can override the platform version configured in `manifest.json` in the `build.gradle`

### Fixed

- Improve platform version detection

This should take care of [#8]

[#8]: https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/issues/8

## [1.2.1] - 2018-12-14

### Fixed

- Keep case of ant target ([#5])

## [1.1.1] - 2018-09-24

### Fixed

- Change glob pattern to match ant directory in 1808

## [1.1.0] - 2018-08-27

### Added

* CCV2 `manifest.json` support \
  Configure your local build using a `manifest.json` file using the new CCV2 build plugin.\
  Details can be found in the [wiki][ccv2.build]!

[ccv2.build]:https://github.com/SAP/commerce-gradle-plugin/wiki/Plugin-mpern.sap.commerce.build.ccv2

### Changed

* `HybrisAntTask` \
  configure Ant properties consistently via the new methods `antProperty(String key, String value)` and `setAntProperties(Map<String,String>)`

  Using the built-in method `systemProperty` (provided by `JavaExec`) doesn't work for all cases, unfortunately

Shout out to [@corneleberle] for providing the fix.
